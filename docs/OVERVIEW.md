# OVERVIEW

This repository provides a **minimal, production-grade** starting point for running TensorFlow workloads on **Azure** using two paths:

- **Azure Machine Learning (AML)** for managed orchestration and tracking.
- **AKS** with a simple **Kubernetes Job** for direct container execution.

All files are **redacted** and use placeholders. See the README for lifecycle and quickstart.
